# Robot Movement

Input can be from a file or from standard input.

If input is from a file, run `./robot.py` followed by filename. Eg: `./robot.py example3.txt` 
Output for example1 will be: `0,1,NORTH`

### Things to implement in the future: 
- Implementing tests
- Perhaps adding something visual on the output
